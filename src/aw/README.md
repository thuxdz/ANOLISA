# AW

[中文版](README_zh.md)

AW provides a shared configuration and local service for Agent policies. On
Linux, it starts Qoder CLI with configured tool Hooks, runs external Providers
and keeps execution metadata independently of the Agent session. Users retain
Qoder's terminal interface and native Hook scheduling. QwenPaw, OpenClaw and
Hermes adapters remain planned; the current interfaces are experimental.

## Available today

| Capability | Availability |
| --- | --- |
| Validate one `aw.yaml` with named Providers and all 16 event names | ✅ |
| Start Qoder CLI 1.1.64 and connect before/after tool Hooks | ✅ Linux source build |
| Run structured Providers before tools (`observe`/`block`) and after successful tools (`observe`) | ✅ |
| Execute native Hook commands with unchanged callback input | ✅ Byte output and exit status returned to Qoder; rewrite chains and approval flows excluded |
| Start or reuse a standalone service and query execution metadata | ✅ |
| Start QwenPaw, OpenClaw or Hermes through AW | ❌ |
| Install a published AW package, request portable approval or enforce policy below native Hooks | ❌ |

## Run Qoder

AW is not yet available through `anolisa install` or an RPM. On Linux, install
rustup and Qoder CLI 1.1.64, then build from the repository root. Update the
example's `spec.agents.qoder.argv` if that Qoder version is outside `PATH`.

```bash
cd src/aw
cargo build --locked -p aw-service --bin aw
target/debug/aw validate --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.qoder.yaml
target/debug/aw run --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.qoder.yaml --agent qoder
```

The example runs a neutral command before and after successful tools. It
demonstrates Hook execution; it does not install security rules. AW starts or
reuses the configured service and opens Qoder's normal interface. Exiting Qoder
returns to the original terminal and releases that session; the shared service
and audit history remain available.

```bash
target/debug/aw status --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.qoder.yaml
target/debug/aw stop --config crates/aw-service/examples/aw.qoder.yaml
```

The [user guide](../../docs/user-guide/en/user-entrypoint/aw.md) explains native
settings coexistence, serial/parallel Hooks, Provider configuration, explicit
service startup and record queries. Native Hooks retain their framework's
limits; service status alone does not prove that Qoder adopted a policy.

## Integration and development

The reusable `aw-service::Client` binds to one service generation and configuration
revision. Adapters normalize callbacks and retain native scheduling. Related
callbacks share one event deadline, and each step may be attempted once. The
service records execution metadata before returning results and never retries
an uncertain call automatically.

`aw-host` supports both structured Provider messages and explicitly selected
native Hook byte transport. `aw-core` provides a separate pinned-plan execution
API and the durable `FileJournal` storage reused by the service. These boundaries
leave cosh, desktop clients and Herdr independent of the service implementation.
